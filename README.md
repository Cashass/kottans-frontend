# Git and Github
Attended the course coursera, week 1 and 2, the presentation of the material is not very good (he installed the git and everything works, few details).
Passed the LearnGitBranching app! Well thought out, makes you think, one nuance is bugs that sometimes do not allow you to properly reach the end of the level. Good course.
