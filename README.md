# Git and Github
Hello, I'm Vitaly. I am 39. 
Happy to join the kottans team.
Attended the course coursera, week 1 and 2, the presentation of the material is not very good (he installed the git and everything works, few details, I would like more details for a beginner).
Passed the LearnGitBranching app! Well thought out, makes you think, one nuance is bugs that sometimes do not allow you to properly reach the end of the level. Good course.

## Git Collaboration
Hi! Attended the Introduction to Git and GitHub course.
I liked working with Git and GitHub. I will continue to improve my skills.
