# Git and Github

Hello, I'm Vitaly. I am 39.
Happy to join the kottans team.
Attended the course coursera, week 1 and 2, the presentation of the material is not very good (he installed the git and everything works, few details, I would like more details for a beginner).
Passed the LearnGitBranching app! Well thought out, makes you think, one nuance is bugs that sometimes do not allow you to properly reach the end of the level. Good course.

## JS Basics

Hi! I just started learning JavaScript. For me, all the information is new and interesting. In my opinion, the information in the FreeCodeCamp exercises and additional materials is clearer than in the Coursera material. Thanks for the course.
